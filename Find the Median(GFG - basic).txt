Given an array arr[] of N integers, calculate the median
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 5
arr[] = 90 100 78 89 67
Output: 89
Explanation: After sorting the array 
middle element is the median 

Example 2:

Input: N = 4
arr[] = 56 67 30 79
Output: 61
Explanation: In case of even number of 
elements, average of two middle elements 
is the median.

 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function find_median() which takes the array as input parameter and returns the floor value of the median.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n * log(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= Length of Array <= 100
1 <= Elements of Array <= 100
                                          //CODE
	int find_median(vector<int> v)
		{
	         int median=0;
	         int index =0;
	         sort(v.begin(),v.end());
		 
		      if(v.size()%2!=0){
		          index = v.size()/2;
		         return v[index];
		           }
		     
                     if(v.size()%2==0){
		     index = v.size()/2;
		      return ((v[index]+v[index-1])/2);
		      }
		      }
